#Ecommerce Back End Project

*User Story*
- AS A manager at an internet retail company
- I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
- SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

*Criteria*
- GIVEN a functional Express.js API
- WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
- THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
- THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

*Difficulties I had...*  
1. Seeding the database
2. Everything else was haulted by problem 1.
